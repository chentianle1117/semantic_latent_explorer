# Testing Checklist - Iterative Semantic Generation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components have been implemented:

### Files Created

- ✅ `models/generator.py` - SemanticGenerator class with SD pipelines
- ✅ `GENERATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide
- ✅ `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### Files Modified

- ✅ `models/embeddings.py` - Added `extract_image_embeddings_from_pil()` method
- ✅ `models/__init__.py` - Added SemanticGenerator import
- ✅ `app.py` - Added generation controls, history panel, integration
- ✅ `README.md` - Added generation workflow information
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Added optional generation dependencies

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Initial Setup Test (2 minutes)

```bash
# Start the app
streamlit run app.py
```

**Expected:** App loads successfully, sidebar shows controls

### 2. Generator Initialization Test (30 seconds)

1. Find "🎨 Generation Workflow" in sidebar
2. Click "Initialize Generator"
3. Wait for loading message

**Expected:**

- Spinner shows "Loading Stable Diffusion..."
- After ~30 seconds: "Generator ready!" message
- Status shows "✅ Generator loaded"

### 3. Initial Batch Generation Test (1 minute)

1. Select mode: "Initial batch"
2. Enter prompt: "sporty premium sneaker design"
3. Set number: 12 images
4. Click "Generate Batch"

**Expected:**

- Progress bar shows generation progress
- Takes ~45-60 seconds
- 12 images appear in semantic space
- Generation history panel appears below plot
- History shows 1 iteration, 12 images

### 4. Reference + Text Generation Test (30 seconds)

1. Select mode: "From reference + text"
2. Enter reference index: 0
3. Enter prompt: "more premium looking"
4. Preview shows reference image
5. Click "Generate from Reference"

**Expected:**

- Single image generates (~5 seconds)
- New image appears near reference in space
- History shows 2 iterations, 13 total images

### 5. Interpolation Generation Test (30 seconds)

1. Select mode: "Interpolate between two"
2. First image: 0
3. Second image: 5
4. Preview shows both images
5. Click "Generate Interpolated"

**Expected:**

- Single image generates (~5 seconds)
- New image appears between the two sources
- History shows 3 iterations, 14 total images

### 6. Generation History Test

Check the "📊 Generation History" panel:

**Expected:**

- Table with 3 rows (3 iterations)
- Methods: Batch Generation, Reference Generation, Interpolation
- Metrics: 3 iterations, 14 total images
- Method breakdown correctly counts each type

### 7. Semantic Space Integration Test

1. Observe the main UMAP visualization
2. Check that generated images:
   - Have proper coordinates
   - Can be hovered over
   - Show in visualization modes
3. Try semantic reorganization with generated images

**Expected:**

- Generated images seamlessly integrated
- No errors about data mismatches
- Images labeled as "Generated" in metadata

## 🎯 Demo Workflow Test (5 minutes)

Test the "sporty but premium" use case:

1. **Initialize:** Load generator
2. **Batch 1:** Generate 12 images with "sporty sneaker design"
3. **Identify:** Find most sporty example (note its index)
4. **Refine 1:** Generate from that reference + "more premium, luxury materials"
5. **Refine 2:** Take best result, generate + "subtle elegant details"
6. **Compare:** Look at progression in semantic space

**Expected:**

- Can complete full workflow without errors
- Images progressively move toward target region
- History clearly tracks the exploration path
- Can demonstrate semantic-guided design iteration

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Out of Memory

**Solution:** Reduce batch size to 6-8 images

### Issue: Slow generation

**Solution:** Normal on lower-end GPUs, just wait longer

### Issue: Generator button doesn't appear

**Solution:** Check that packages are installed: `pip list | grep diffusers`

### Issue: Images don't match prompt well

**Solution:** Try more detailed prompts, or use reference mode

### Issue: Generated images appear far from expected location

**Solution:** This is normal - CLIP and SD may interpret concepts differently

## ✅ Success Criteria

All tests pass if:

- ✅ Generator initializes without errors
- ✅ All three generation modes work
- ✅ Images appear in semantic space automatically
- ✅ Generation history tracks correctly
- ✅ Can complete demo workflow end-to-end
- ✅ No data mismatch errors
- ✅ Progress indicators work properly

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

On RTX 4060:

- Model load: ~20-30 seconds
- Single image: 3-5 seconds
- Batch of 12: 45-60 seconds
- Memory usage: ~6GB VRAM

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:

1. Practice the demo workflow
2. Try different prompts
3. Explore semantic axes with generated images
4. Document interesting findings
5. Prepare demo presentation

## 📝 Notes

- First generation creates new UMAP space
- Subsequent generations add to existing space using transform
- Generated images get "Generated" category in metadata
- All PIL images automatically get CLIP embeddings
- History persists across reruns (session state)
