# React Implementation Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Selection Logic âœ…
**Problem**: Had to click "Clear Canvas" to select images, selection was inconsistent
**Fix**:
- Made selection **additive by default** - clicking images toggles them in/out of selection
- Click anywhere on canvas background to deselect all
- Fixed button label from "Clear Canvas" to proper "ðŸ”„ Clear Canvas" (which clears ALL images, not selection)
- Floating action panel now closes when clicking canvas background

### 2. Click-to-Deselect âœ…
**Problem**: Couldn't click empty space to deselect
**Fix**:
- Click on canvas background (SVG) now clears selection and closes floating panel
- Press ESC key also clears selection and closes all panels

### 3. Floating Action Panel Behavior âœ…
**Problem**: Panel sometimes didn't show up or appeared in wrong place
**Fix**:
- Panel now consistently appears next to selected images
- Panel automatically closes when:
  - Clicking anywhere on canvas background
  - Clicking outside the panel
  - Pressing ESC key
  - Selection count reaches 0

### 4. Axis Update Functionality âœ…
**Problem**: Axis labels didn't update correctly, API call format was wrong
**Fix**:
- Fixed API call format to match backend expectations:
  ```typescript
  {
    x_negative: "formal",
    x_positive: "sporty",
    y_negative: "dark",
    y_positive: "colorful"
  }
  ```
- After axis update, images are automatically reorganized
- User gets confirmation alert when axis update succeeds

### 5. End-to-End Functionality âœ…
All generation pipelines are now connected:
- âœ… Generate from reference (single image)
- âœ… Interpolation (two images)
- âœ… Batch generation (initial)
- âœ… WebSocket updates for real-time canvas refresh

## How to Use

### Selection Workflow
1. **Click an image** â†’ Floating panel appears with "Generate with prompt..."
2. **Click another image** â†’ Both are now selected, panel shows "Interpolate between (2 selected)"
3. **Click a selected image again** â†’ Deselects that image
4. **Click canvas background** â†’ Deselects all and closes panel

### Generation Workflows

#### Generate from Reference (1 image selected)
1. Select an image
2. Click "âœ¨ Generate with prompt..." in floating panel
3. Enter prompt in dialog (e.g., "more minimalist, brighter colors")
4. Adjust variation strength slider
5. Click "Generate"
6. New image appears on canvas with genealogy tracked

#### Interpolate Between Images (2 images selected)
1. Select two images
2. Click "ðŸ”€ Interpolate between (2 selected)" in floating panel
3. New interpolated image appears on canvas
4. Genealogy shows both parents

#### Update Axis Labels
1. Click X or Y axis label at bottom/left of canvas
2. Enter new labels in format: "negative ... positive"
   - Example: "casual ... formal"
3. Images automatically reorganize based on new semantic axes

### Visual Feedback
- **Orange border** = Selected image
- **Blue border** = Hovered image
- **Green dashed lines** = Parent relationships (upstream)
- **Orange dashed lines** = Child relationships (downstream)
- **Animated dashes** = Flow direction of genealogy
- **Pulsing orange glow** = Images in hovered history group

## Backend Integration

The React frontend connects to FastAPI backend on port 8000:
- REST API for generation operations
- WebSocket for real-time state updates
- Images automatically appear on canvas after generation

## Known Limitations

1. Multi-image batch generation (3+ images) - Coming soon
2. Cluster analysis - Coming soon
3. View image details - Coming soon

## Next Steps for Development

1. Add image detail modal showing:
   - Full resolution image
   - Embedding vector
   - Generation parameters
   - Genealogy tree

2. Implement batch generation from multiple references
3. Add export functionality (save canvas state, export images)
4. Add semantic search (find similar images)
5. Implement undo/redo for generations
