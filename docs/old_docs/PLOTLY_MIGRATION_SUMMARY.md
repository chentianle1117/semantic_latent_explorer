# Plotly Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Zappos Semantic Explorer from Bokeh to Plotly for improved performance and better UI/UX. The migration maintains all interactive functionality while providing a more compact and well-aligned interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Plotly Canvas Component

**File:** `visualization/plotly_canvas.py`

- Created a new Plotly-based interactive canvas to replace the Bokeh implementation
- Maintained all core features:
  - Image display in semantic latent space
  - Genealogy visualization (parent/child relationships)
  - Interactive hover tooltips with genealogy information
  - Selection highlighting with color-coded borders
  - Group color coding (batch, reference, interpolation, dataset)
- Improved features:
  - Better image rendering using Plotly's layout images
  - Smoother pan and zoom interactions
  - More responsive hover tooltips
  - Cleaner visual appearance

### 2. Updated App Layout

**File:** `app.py`

#### Layout Optimization

- **Canvas Area**: Now occupies 70% of viewport height (70vh)
  - Canvas to settings ratio changed from 5:1 to 6:1 for better space utilization
  - Main plot takes center stage with optimal sizing
- **Control Panel**: Occupies 25% of viewport height (25vh)

  - Maintains 2:3 ratio between quick actions and history timeline
  - Compact and focused design

- **Compact Header**:
  - Title on left, subtitle on right in a single row
  - Reduced vertical space usage

#### CSS Improvements

- Reduced padding throughout the app for a more compact feel
- Better alignment of all UI elements
- Responsive flexbox layout for consistent sizing
- Optimized spacing for buttons, sliders, and form elements
- Compact stats badge and history cards

#### Event Handling

- Updated selection handling to work with Plotly click events
- Replaced `st.bokeh_chart()` with `st.plotly_chart()`
- Better event processing for image selection

### 3. Settings Panel Updates

**File:** `components/settings_panel.py`

- Adjusted default image size from 120px to 100px (optimized for Plotly)
- Updated preset buttons to use compact single-letter labels (S, M, L)
- Modified preset sizes: 60px, 100px, 150px (optimized for new canvas)

### 4. Updated Dependencies

**File:** `requirements.txt`

- Removed: `bokeh>=3.3.0`
- Kept: `plotly>=5.11.0` (already present)
- All other dependencies remain unchanged

### 5. Module Export Updates

**File:** `visualization/__init__.py`

- Changed import from `bokeh_canvas` to `plotly_canvas`
- All function signatures remain the same for backward compatibility

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Layout

1. **Focused Canvas**: The main semantic latent space plot is now the clear focal point
2. **Compact Sidebar**: Settings are easily accessible but don't dominate the screen
3. **Efficient Control Panel**: Generation controls and history are well-organized and compact
4. **Better Proportions**:
   - 70% canvas area
   - 25% control panel
   - 5% header/margins

### Interaction Improvements

1. **Plotly Advantages**:
   - Smoother pan and zoom
   - Better hover performance
   - Cleaner image rendering
   - Built-in screenshot/export tools
2. **Maintained Features**:
   - Click to select images
   - Hover to see genealogy connections
   - Color-coded groups
   - Visual settings (size, opacity, background removal)
   - Axis customization

### Performance

- Plotly generally performs better with many data points
- Faster rendering of images on canvas
- More efficient memory usage for large datasets
- Better support for future enhancements (3D plots, animations, etc.)

## Migration Benefits

### Technical Benefits

1. **Modern Stack**: Plotly is more actively maintained than Bokeh
2. **Better Integration**: Native Plotly support in Streamlit
3. **Flexibility**: Easier to add new features and visualizations
4. **Performance**: Better handling of large datasets
5. **Documentation**: More extensive Plotly documentation and community support

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: More compact and professional appearance
2. **Better Alignment**: All elements properly aligned and sized
3. **Responsive Design**: Better viewport utilization
4. **Intuitive Controls**: Standard Plotly interaction patterns
5. **Export Options**: Built-in screenshot and data export

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:

- All function signatures remain the same
- Data structures unchanged (ImageMetadata, HistoryGroup)
- Same session state variables
- Same component interfaces

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Canvas renders correctly with images
- [x] Image selection works (click to select)
- [x] Hover tooltips display genealogy information
- [x] Visual settings (size, opacity) work correctly
- [x] Axis labels display properly
- [x] Stats badge shows correct information
- [x] Layout proportions are optimal (70/25 split)
- [x] Settings sidebar is compact and scrollable
- [x] Control panel is well-organized
- [x] All buttons and controls are properly sized

## Future Enhancements Enabled

With Plotly, the following features are now easier to implement:

1. **3D Semantic Space**: Add a third dimension to the latent space
2. **Animation**: Animate transitions between different projections
3. **Advanced Tooltips**: Add image previews directly in tooltips
4. **Clustering Visualization**: Better support for cluster boundaries
5. **Genealogy Graphs**: Dedicated genealogy tree visualizations
6. **Export Options**: Export plots in various formats (PNG, SVG, HTML)

## Notes

- The old `bokeh_canvas.py` file is still present but no longer used (can be removed if desired)
- All genealogy tracking features are preserved
- Color scheme and theme remain unchanged
- The migration is complete and ready for production use
