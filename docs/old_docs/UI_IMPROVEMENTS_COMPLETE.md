## Summary

All requested UI/UX improvements have been implemented based on the provided HTML mockup.

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Fixed Zoom Reset Issue

**Problem**: Canvas would reset zoom/pan every time new images were added.

**Solution**:

- Added `zoomTransformRef` to persist zoom state between re-renders
- Zoom/pan transform is now restored after canvas updates
- File: `frontend/src/components/Canvas/SemanticCanvas.tsx`

```typescript
const zoomTransformRef = useRef<d3.ZoomTransform | null>(null);

// Save zoom state on zoom
.on("zoom", (event) => {
  g.attr("transform", event.transform);
  zoomTransformRef.current = event.transform;
});

// Restore previous zoom state
if (zoomTransformRef.current) {
  svg.call(zoom.transform as any, zoomTransformRef.current);
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. Fixed Direct Click Selection

**Problem**: Had to press Ctrl to select multiple images; direct clicking was restrictive.

**Solution**:

- Changed click handler to always allow toggle selection (multi-select by default)
- Removed Ctrl/Cmd requirement
- File: `frontend/src/components/Canvas/SemanticCanvas.tsx`

```typescript
.on("click", function (event, d) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  // Direct selection without Ctrl/Cmd - just toggle
  toggleImageSelection(d.id, true);
});
```

---

### ✅ 3. Fixed Clear Canvas

**Problem**: Clear canvas wasn't actually clearing images.

**Solution**:

- Added state refresh after clear API call
- Forces UI to update with empty state
- File: `frontend/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
const handleClear = async () => {
  await apiClient.clearCanvas();
  const state = await apiClient.getState();
  setImages(state.images);
  setHistoryGroups(state.history_groups);
  clearSelection();
  setFloatingPanelPos(null);
};
```

---

### ✅ 4. Added Rounded Corners to Images

**Problem**: Images were circular, needed consistent rounded square visuals.

**Solution**:

- Changed all circle elements to rounded rects (`rx="8"`)
- Used `clip-path: inset(0 round 8px)` for image rounding
- Applied 8px border-radius consistently
- Files: `frontend/src/components/Canvas/SemanticCanvas.tsx`

**Before**: Circle borders and circular images
**After**: Rounded square borders (8px radius) and images

---

### ✅ 5. Created Floating Action Panel

**Problem**: Context menu was the only way to interact; needed floating panel next to selected images.

**Solution**:

- Created new `FloatingActionPanel` component
- Appears to the right of selected image(s)
- Shows different actions based on selection count:
  - **1 image**: Generate, View Details, Remove
  - **2 images**: Interpolate, Generate batch, Clear selection
  - **3+ images**: Generate from selection, Analyze cluster, Clear selection
- Files:
  - `frontend/src/components/FloatingActionPanel/FloatingActionPanel.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/FloatingActionPanel/FloatingActionPanel.css`

```typescript
<FloatingActionPanel
  x={floatingPanelPos.x}
  y={floatingPanelPos.y}
  selectedCount={floatingPanelPos.count}
  onGenerateFromReference={...}
  onInterpolate={...}
  onViewDetails={...}
  onRemove={...}
  onClearSelection={...}
/>
```

---

### ✅ 6. Show Genealogy on Selection

**Problem**: Genealogy only appeared on hover, not on selection.

**Solution**:

- Added genealogy rendering for all selected images
- Genealogy persists as long as images are selected
- File: `frontend/src/components/Canvas/SemanticCanvas.tsx`

```typescript
// Show genealogy for selected images
if (selectedImageIds.length > 0) {
  selectedImageIds.forEach((selectedId) => {
    const selectedImg = images.find((img) => img.id === selectedId);
    if (selectedImg) {
      drawGenealogy(selectedImg);
    }
  });
}
```

---

### ✅ 7. Fixed Quick Actions Overflow

**Problem**: Buttons would overflow the quick actions panel.

**Solution**:

- Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to `.action-row`
- Simplified quick actions to show only essential buttons
- Added info message when images are selected
- Files:
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/styles/app.css`

```css
.action-row {
  display: flex;
  gap: 8px;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Prevent overflow */
  align-items: center;
}
```

---

### ✅ 8. Axis Reorganization

**Problem**: Changing axis labels didn't reorganize images in latent space.

**Solution**:

- Added backend API call when axis labels are changed
- Canvas will reorganize images based on new semantic axes
- File: `frontend/src/components/Canvas/SemanticCanvas.tsx`

```typescript
onClick={async () => {
  // Update labels
  useAppStore.setState({ axisLabels: newLabels });

  // Call backend to reorganize
  await apiClient.updateAxes({ axis_labels: newLabels });
}}
```

---

### ✅ 9. Improved Interpolation Error Handling

**Problem**: Interpolation errors were not user-friendly.

**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Clear error messages for users
- Better logging for debugging
- File: `frontend/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
try {
  await apiClient.interpolate({ id_a, id_b, alpha: 0.5 });
  clearSelection();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Interpolation failed:", error);
  alert("Interpolation failed. Check console for details.");
}
```

## Visual Improvements

### Rounded Corners (8px)

- All images now have filleted corners
- Selection borders match image shape
- Hover borders match image shape
- Parent/child borders match image shape

### Floating Action Panel

- Appears at `(selectedImageX + 60px, selectedImageY)`
- Smooth fade-slide animation
- Context-aware actions based on selection count
- Blue glow shadow for emphasis

### Interaction Flow

1. Click image → Image selected with orange border
2. Floating panel appears to the right
3. Genealogy lines show parents (green) and children (orange)
4. Click action in panel → Action executes
5. Click elsewhere → Selection clears

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Direct Multi-Select

- No need to hold Ctrl/Cmd
- Click any image to toggle selection
- More intuitive for touch devices
- Matches HTML mockup behavior

### Persistent Zoom

- Pan and zoom state preserved across:
  - New image generation
  - Axis label changes
  - Image selection
  - Settings changes

### Clear Visual Feedback

- Selected images: Orange border
- Hovered images: Blue border
- Parent images: Green border
- Child images: Orange border
- Group highlighted: Pulsing orange glow
