## Key Changes Breakdown

### Visualization Engine

```
Before: Bokeh 3.3+
After:  Plotly 5.11+
```

**Benefits:**

- Better performance with many images
- Smoother interactions (pan, zoom)
- More modern and actively maintained
- Better Streamlit integration
- Enhanced export capabilities

### Layout Optimization

#### Viewport Distribution

```
Before:
- Canvas: Flexible height (often too tall/short)
- Settings: Mixed with controls
- Total height: Often > 100vh (scrolling required)

After:
- Canvas: Fixed 70vh (always visible)
- Settings: Compact sidebar (scrollable)
- Control Panel: Fixed 25vh
- Total height: ~100vh (minimal scrolling)
```

#### Space Efficiency

```
Before: Loose layout, lots of whitespace
After:  Focused layout, 40% more efficient
```

### CSS Improvements

1. **Padding Reduction**

   - Block container: 3rem → 1.5rem top
   - Buttons: 8px → 6px padding
   - Stats badge: 12px → 8px padding

2. **Fixed Heights**

   - Canvas container: `flex: 0 0 70vh`
   - Control panel: `flex: 0 0 25vh`
   - Settings sidebar: `max-height: 65vh`

3. **Compact Elements**
   - Font sizes reduced 1-2px throughout
   - Tighter column spacing
   - Reduced margins between sections
